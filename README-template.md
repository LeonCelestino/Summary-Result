### What I learned

I used this project to learn how to built responsive layouts from scratch and with pure technologies. I was used to take too long to make even the easiest of easiest layouts, and I am taking a time to make challenges from Frontend Mentor to develop more "fluency" and be a bit faster in building layouts.

With this project I was able to learn more about HSL, which before I never have thought about using it, just the common rgb, rgba and hex. 

Greatful about friends and contacts, I was also able of learning more about best practices and performances, and I am still improving the code of this project constantly by the means of getting better everyday.

### Continued development

I will be doing my best to improve in means of best practices, accessibility and performance.

### Useful resources

- [Adobe Colors](https://color.adobe.com/pt/) - With this website I was able to pick up colors which I was in doubt.
